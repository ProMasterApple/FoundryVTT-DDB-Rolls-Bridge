## v0.1.4
- Groups nested D&D Beyond dice nodes into one roll payload.
- Stops initial page-load backfill to avoid importing old rolls.
- Adds dice summary/count to the Foundry chat card.
- Keeps the v0.1.2 Foundry ChatMessage fix.


## v0.1.4
- Ignores interim D&D Beyond placeholder rolls such as `?` / `... NOW`.
- Waits for the completed roll result before forwarding to Foundry.
- Watches text-node updates inside the same D&D Beyond roll card, not just newly-added elements.
